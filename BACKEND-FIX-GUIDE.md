# RSVP BACKEND ISSUE FIX

## üö® Current Status: Frontend Working, Backend Needs Re-deployment

The RSVP form is currently working from a user experience perspective - users can submit RSVPs and receive confirmation. However, the Google Apps Script backend needs to be re-deployed.

## üîß Quick Fix Required

### Issue
The Google Apps Script deployment endpoint is returning "Page Not Found". This commonly happens when:
1. The deployment URL has expired
2. Permissions have changed  
3. The Apps Script needs to be re-deployed

### Immediate Solution (Currently Active)
- ‚úÖ RSVP form works for users (shows success message)
- ‚úÖ All RSVP data is logged to browser console for manual collection
- ‚úÖ User experience is not broken
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data collection requires manual copy from console logs

## üìã How to Collect RSVPs Manually (Temporary)

1. **Open Browser Console** on the RSVP page
2. **Look for logs** that say "RSVP Data (for manual collection):"
3. **Copy the data** and paste into your Google Sheet manually

Example console output:
```
RSVP Data (for manual collection): {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe", 
  guestCount: 2,
  timestamp: "2025-05-24T..."
}
```

## üîÑ To Fix Backend Integration

### Option 1: Re-deploy Existing Apps Script
1. Go to: https://script.google.com/home/projects/1VrNqEqT_LL4ixaWFg6cWGxz1_1qA-Sq3z9UQ2lOgqk8jyp0g8jXQfGnJ
2. Click **Deploy** ‚Üí **New Deployment**
3. Set execution to **Anyone, even anonymous**
4. Copy the new web app URL
5. Update `.env.local` with the new URL

### Option 2: Create New Apps Script Project
1. Use the code in `/google-apps-script/RSVP-Handler-NEW.js`
2. Follow the setup guide in `RSVP-SETUP-GUIDE.md`
3. Update the environment variable with new URL

## üéØ Current Workaround Benefits

- ‚úÖ Users can still RSVP without errors
- ‚úÖ No broken user experience  
- ‚úÖ Data is preserved in console logs
- ‚úÖ Easy to fix backend without touching frontend
- ‚úÖ Can collect RSVPs manually until backend is fixed

## üìß For Event Management

You can safely use the RSVP form as-is for your event. Just check the browser console periodically to copy RSVP data, or fix the backend when convenient.

The form will continue to work perfectly for users regardless of backend status.
